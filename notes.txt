Newtons first law: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
Newtons second law: The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied. (F = ma)
Newtons third law: Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.
